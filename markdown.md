# Markdown

We are going to use Markdown to format our content in this project. [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown):

> **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.
> 
> (...)
> 
> The key design goal is _readability_ â€“ that the lan guage be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions, unlike text formatted with a markup language, such as (...) HTML, which have obvious tags and formatting instructions. 

You will find the [basics about its syntax in the GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) which you can use as reference or through the [Mastering Markdown GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Additionally, you can also follow this [simple Markdown tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/
) if you need a more guided solution, or even the [more thorough Codecademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-intermediate-en-Bw3bg/0/1
