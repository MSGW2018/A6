# **THE FUTURE OF THE MEDIA AND JOURNALISM**

### TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, SOCIAL CHANGE.

With the introduction of new technologies, it is indisputable that society has undergone a major change. We have changed the way of being informed, of communicating, of relating ... As a result of this change, journalism does not have the transcendent role of informing today. Some people, the most positive, think that journalism is in transition, in continuous change. But others, think that journalism is coming to an end.

### TRADITIONAL MEDIA VS INTERNET 

Traditional media mainly, throughout history have played the role of informing, but it is not the only one. They also had the function of educating, entertaining, socializing, marketing or advertising ... It is true that some of these functions can be performed by using internet us a users, but not all of them.

### EXPERIENCE JOURNALISM

All from our experience we can create information from different perspectives, from different feelings, or you can even invent it. But, it is true that, that users have the option to issue information does not mean that we have the ability to reach society.

### PLACE IN THE FUTURE

On the one hand, the media and the journalism, have had until the emergence of ICT the strength and power to select the news and choose the truthful point of view to transfer it to society. This power, still retains it and is an important weapon for society. Among so much information users want us to tell us what information is true and what is not.

On the other hand, as mentioned above, the media have also had the function of educating, which is essential to guide this society without control. We all have a mobile phone, computer ... with internet and very few know how to use it in its entirety. Therefore, the media should be a brake so that society does not lose that control.

It is true that the other functions have been absorbed by the internet. But researching and rushing to the new changes that ICTs can offer us, it is clear that the media must have a place in society. Since, no user has the ability to educate or label a news as truthful for society.
