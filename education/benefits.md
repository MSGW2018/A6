# BENEFITS 

Expanding educational opportunities is more possible now than it has ever been before. Open education improves the experience of both educators and learners. The main benefits of this new way of learning are the following ones: 

1. It brings financial benefits for students/institutions :moneybag:
   - The price of textbooks has raised significantly in the last decades. College students face steep price tags that can top $200 per book, and schools use books for many years out of date because they are too expensive to replace. Using Open Education Resources (OER) solves this problem because material is free online, affordable in print, and can be saved forever. 

2. It enhances quality and flexibility of resources :books: :+1:
   - Open education resources can be constantly updated without cost; they can be used, reused, edited, remixed and repurposed
without restrictions. Besides, people from all over the world can be contributing to the same topic or area of education. Thanks to that, teachers can compare their own teaching materials with other teachers all around the world. Imagine an American History textbook with the latest news from the run-up to the 2018 election, or a peer-to-peer exchange between Canadian students learning Mandarin with Chinese students learning English or French. 

3.  It allows a more personalised learning :ok_woman:
    - By using OER, students are exposed to different educational resources that are in accordance with their learning style. This can increse interest and can make students become more active by collaborating in virtual communities. 

4. Better education means a better future. :rainbow:
   - Education is the key to advancing societyâ€™s greatest goals, from a building a strong economy to leading healthy lives. By increasing access to education and creating a platform for more effective teaching and learning, Open Education benefits us all.
5. Ability to learn at any time and anywere.
With this educational sistem, you can learn in any place and anywhere. Yu only need a computer and internet connection, also some motivation of learning alone because you are not going to have a supervisor to control your work.
