# Open Education awards for excelente 2018 winners

The Open Education Awards for Excellence are presented each year at the OEGC and provide annual recognition to outstanding contributions in the Open Education community. Award categories are reviewed each year to make sure they remain current, relevant and also reflect the emerging innovations in the Open Education movement. 

This year’s new categories include other areas of openness that not only impact, but also support the Open Education practices, so we can stand for a world of tolerance where knowledge is openly and freely accessible.
