“Every single one of you has something that you’re good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That’s the opportunity an education can provide”. Barack Obama

There is no doubt that guaranteeing a quality education for everyone has to be a priority if we want to develop as a society. Unfortunately, there are many barriers that impede many people to have an appropriate education. That is why we should invest in alternatives to eliminate this barriers. An interesting one is open education. 

Open education is a philosophy about the way people should produce, share, and build on knowledge.Proponents of open education believe everyone in the world should have access to high-quality educational experiences and resources, and they work to eliminate barriers to this goal. Such barriers might include high monetary costs, outdated or obsolete materials, and legal mechanisms that prevent collaboration among scholars and educators.
