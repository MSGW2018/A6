# INTERNATIONALIZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION

The term “internationalization” covers different things and includes different dimensions, with different levels of higher education. The definition of internationalization of higher education varies and depends on the stakeholder groups, government, private sector, institution, faculty member, academic discipline and student. 

Those differing perspectives result in several reasons for many program approaches to internationalization of higher education. A commonly accepted definition in this study is Knight’s definition, that says: “Internationalization of higher education is the process of integrating an international/intercultural dimension into the teaching, research and service elements of an institution”. 

That definition is accepted, giving its emphasis on the process and on the three important functional dimensions of universities: teaching, research and service. Apart from this, there are also three key concepts in this definition:
1. The idea of internationalization is that it is a dynamic process and not a set of isolated activities. 
1. Integration and infusion ensure that the international dimension is a central part of programs, policies, and procedures, not marginal, yet an easily expandable element. 
1. Both international and intercultural dimension emphasize the fact that internationalization is not only oriented to countries or national states, taking into account the fact that it also includes different cultural or ethnic groups within a country.
