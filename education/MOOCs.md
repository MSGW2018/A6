MOOCS or Massive Open Online Courses is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web. This concept is practically new and it is in the way of transformation and settlement.[Source](http://www.globalnewlightofmyanmar.com/massive-open-online-courses-moocs/)

In **The MOOC model for digital practice**, a clear definition of a MOOC can be found:

*A MOOC is an online course with the option of free and open registration, a publicly-shared curriculum, and open-ended outcomes. MOOCs integrate social networking, accessible online resources, and are facilitated by leading practitioners in the field of study. Most significantly, MOOCs build on the engagement of learners who self-organize their participation according to learning goals, prior knowledge and skills, and common interests.*[Source](http://desarrolloweb.dlsi.ua.es/moocs/what-is-a-mooc)

Before the Digital Age, distance learning appeared in the form of correspondence courses in the 1890s–1920s and later radio and television broadcast of courses and early forms of e-learning. Typically fewer than five percent of the students would complete a course. The 2000s saw changes in online, or e-learning and distance education, with increasing online presence, open learning opportunities, and the development of MOOCs.[Source](https://books.google.es/books?id=E1QcDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT34&lpg=PT34&dq=Before+the+Digital+Age,+distance+learning+appeared+in+the+form+of+correspondence+courses+in+the+1890s%E2%80%931920s+and+later+radio+and+television+broadcast+of+courses+and+early+forms+of+e-learning.+Typically+fewer+than+five+percent+of+the+students+would+complete+a+course.+The+2000s+saw+changes+in+online,+or+e-learning+and+distance+education,+with+increasing+online+presence,+open+learning+opportunities,+and+the+development+of+MOOCs.&source=bl&ots=9cyRoRzhEH&sig=kAyI3m9TKJxWs4dQqq0Cnae-qeQ&hl=hu&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLw9-WhOzaAhUoyKYKHQwZA8IQ6AEIPDAC#v=onepage&q=Before%20the%20Digital%20Age%2C%20distance%20learning%20appeared%20in%20the%20form%20of%20correspondence%20courses%20in%20the%201890s%E2%80%931920s%20and%20later%20radio%20and%20television%20broadcast%20of%20courses%20and%20early%20forms%20of%20e-learning.%20Typically%20fewer%20than%20five%20percent%20of%20the%20students%20would%20complete%20a%20course.%20The%202000s%20saw%20changes%20in%20online%2C%20or%20e-learning%20and%20distance%20education%2C%20with%20increasing%20online%20presence%2C%20open%20learning%20opportunities%2C%20and%20the%20development%20of%20MOOCs.&f=false)
