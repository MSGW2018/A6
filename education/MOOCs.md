In **The MOOC model for digital practice**, a clear definition of a MOOC can be found:

*A MOOC is an online course with the option of free and open registration, a publicly-shared curriculum, and open-ended outcomes. MOOCs integrate social networking, accessible online resources, and are facilitated by leading practitioners in the field of study. Most significantly, MOOCs build on the engagement of learners who self-organize their participation according to learning goals, prior knowledge and skills, and common interests.*

Before the Digital Age, distance learning appeared in the form of correspondence courses in the 1890sâ€“1920s and later radio and television broadcast of courses and early forms of e-learning. Typically fewer than five percent of the students would complete a course. The 2000s saw changes in online, or e-learning and distance education, with increasing online presence, open learning opportunities, and the development of MOOCs

At the beginning, as an open education, MOOCS have an orientation of freely deep colaborative philosophy. Nowadays, this term has changed and it has develop to a more commercial sense.
