# CONCEPT OF OPEN EDUCATION

Open education is a philosophy about the opportunity everyone should have to study and to have access to certain knowledge.
This type of education encompasses resources, tools and practices that can be chared and be fuly used in the digital environment. People who have proposed open education believe that everyone in the world should have the right to enjoy a high-quality education, so they work to overcome the barriers and the limits it has.

Under the name: **Open Educational Resources (OER)**, the foundation teaches, learns, and researches barrier free resources. They also carry legal permission for open use. Generally, this permission is granted by using an open license. It also allows anyone to freely use, adapt and share the source anytime, anywhere, as well as to modify, translate, change or add any type of other information. 

[**The Open Education Consortium**](http://www.oeconsortium.org/) is a global network of educational institutions, individuals and organizations that support an approach to education based on openness, including collaboration, innovation and collective development and use of open educational materials. The Open Education Consortium is a non-profit, social benefit organization registered in the United States and operating worldwide. This organisation has declared that:
	*"Sharing is probably the most basic characteristic of education: education is sharing knowledge, insights and information with others, upon which new knowledge, skills, ideas and understanding can be built."*
