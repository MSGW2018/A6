# History of open education

Even before the computer was developed, researchers at public universities were working at educating citizens through informal education programs. 

In the early 1900s, 4-H clubs were formed which taught youth the latest in technological advances in agriculture and home economics. The success that the youth had in utilizing "new" methods of farming and home economics, caused their parents to adopt the same practices.

Since then, as the 4-H club idea was spreading across the country, Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act which created the Cooperative Extension Service in the United States Department of Agriculture. The Cooperative Extension Service is recognised as a partnership between the USDA, land grant universities in each state, and counties throughout the United States. Through the work of the Cooperative Extension Services and 4-H, people throughout the United States have easy and inexpensive (most often free) access to the latest research done without having to visit a college campus or attend college courses. 

The educational programs and resources offered by 4-H and the Cooperative Extension Service give to the citizen the chance to meet people where they are, and offer them the opportunity to learn what they want to learn on their own schedules. The thing is that in order to meet the changing needs of citizens and the use of new technology, the Cooperative Extension Service has created extension, which provides research based on a wide variety of topics to people through the use of the internet.

The ability to share resources on the web at little cost compared to the distribution of hard copies can facilitate open education. An early example of this is the opencourseware program, established in 2002 by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which was followed by more than 200 universities and organizations. MOOC is a more recent form of online course development getting more attention since the fall of 2011 which was followed by a number of non-certificate-granting programs.
