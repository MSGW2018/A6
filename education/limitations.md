# LIMITATIONS

Despite its numerous advantages, OER is still in the early adoption stage, and the spread of their usage is still slowed by a series of factors. The main limitations that open education faces nowadays are the following:

1. Quality issues
- Since many OER repositories allow any user to create an account and post material, some resources may not be relevant and/or accurate.

2. Lack of human interaction between teachers and students
- OER material is created to stand alone, and since self-learning users may access the material outside of a classroom environment, they will miss out the discussion and instructor feedback that characterize for-credit classes and make them useful and valuable.

3. Language and cultural barriers
- Although efforts are being made to make OERs available in multiple languages, many are only available in English, limiting their usefulness to non-English speakers. Moreover, not all resources are culturally appropriate for all audiences.

4. Technological issues
- Some students may have trouble using some OERs if they have a slow or erratic Internet connection. Other OERs may require software that students do not have and that may not be able to afford.
