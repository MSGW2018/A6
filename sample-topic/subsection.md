With the Internet revolution this graphic has completely changed and the more specific products now are becoming more profitable. 
The Internet has changed the rules of distribution and market, which seemed immovable and definitive.Today online businesses, such as Amazon, are no longer based exclusively on broad market segments, that is, on the general public.
The sum of small niche markets, that is, the specific and defined customer groups, often supposes a volume of business greater than the large mass of clients.

It must be said, that the long tail theory is based on three things: the democratization of access to production, the democratization of access to distribution and connecting demand with supply.
