# Open Government

**The Internet, social media, phones, and all the different contemporary gadgets** that allow citizens to communicate have changed our life dramatically. From our day to day relationships, to our long time friends and partners... every communication channel has experienced a change in the last two decades and so has the way of accessing the governments platforms, products and services.

The concept of Open Government does not have a clear definition. But it is most connected to ideas of government transparency and accountability. It is about the limit of government openness to information released by the government and the extent to which citizens can request or propose changings before the actual publishing or passing of a law.  

The change in the business area with _e-commerce_ as one of their biggest new branches has made a change in the populations minds and now we demand something similar with evert other aspect, including politics. People demand transparent access to information and a competent service delivery from their governments. As a result of this, we also demand tailored services and policies that solve our needs and address our concerns.  

**The new way of properly addressing this population from a government point of view would have to be open government**. The opening up of governments proceedings, documents and data for public scrutiny and involvement is now considered as a fundamental element for a democratic society. This will pay an essential role for regaining the trust of citizens in the neutrality and reliability of public administrations

[Examples of open government initiatives](https://www.oecd.org/gov/open-gov-way-forward-highlights.pdf) can be open budget and participatory budgeting, open parliament, open contracting and town hall meetings. In the context of the Internet, it can be said that the open government strategies can be provided through the Internet to the public quite easily. In this sense, it is easy to publish budgetting of the government on the governmentÂ´s websites.
