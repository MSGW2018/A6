# Open Government

**The Internet, social media, phones, and all the different contemporary gadgets** that allow citizens to communicate have changed our life dramatically. From our day to day relationships, to our long time friends and partners... every communication channel has experienced a change in the last two decades and so has the way of accessing the governments platforms, products and services.

The change in the business area with _e-commerce_ as one of their biggest new branches has made a change in the populations minds and now we demand something similar with evert other aspect, including politics. People demand transparent access to information and a competent service delivery from their governments. As a result of this, we also demand tailored services and policies that solve our needs and address our concerns.  

**The new way of properly addressing this population from a government point of view would have to be open government**. The opening up of governments proceedings, documents and data for public scrutiny and involvement is now considered as a fundamental element for a democratic society. This will pay an essential role for regaining the trust of citizens in the neutrality and reliability of public administrations
