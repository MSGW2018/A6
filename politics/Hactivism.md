# _Hacktivism_

**In this part of our topic we will be talking about hacktivism.**

**What is hacktivism?**

If we take a close look to this term, we can find out that it is the result of the mix of activism (action of using vigorous campaigning to bring about political or social change) and hacking (gain unauthorized data in a system or computer). So hacktivism is the act of hacking a website or computer network in an effort to convey a social or political message. Therefore we could define a hacktivist as a person that breaks into any computer or system for a politically or socially motivated purpose.  In the bottom line, **any hacktivist has to become a hacker first**, because without all the coding knowledge there will be no way for him to protest about social, political or economical affairs. 

**Is hacktivism good :+1: or bad :thumbsdown: ?**

Activism itself is no crime, but when your are accessing restricted platforms and thus becoming a hacker, the law will put you in trouble. This is no surprise since it would be way too chaotic if anyone had total freedom of speech (and access) to every platform. But when it comes to making noise online, a hacktivist is on top of the ranking for sure. Some other acts of hacktivism are website defacement, denial-of-service attacks (DoS), redirects, website parodies, information theft, virtual sabotage and virtual sit-ins. Most of these are considered to be illegal acts, however, since the damages incurred in most hacktivist activities are considered relatively minor, few of these cases actually are carried through to prosecution. In addition, because of the global nature of hacktivism and the anonymous face of most of the people involved, it’s difficult to track down who is actually responsible.

**Hacktivism or cyberterrorism?**

Many people don't know the difference between hacktivism and cyberterrorism. However their only similatiry is that they are   both carried out mostly online. Cyberterrorism aims to cause severe harm, such as bodily casualties or financial damages. In the other hand, hacktivism aims to raise awareness around a particular issue. For example, there have been several instances of hacktivists working together to promote avenues for free speech in countries with authoritarian policies that restrict access to information. In this [TEDx Talk video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LulzSec) Jennifer Arcuri explains why hacktivism is so important in a 21st century economy. 

**What are the most common targets for hacktivists?** :dart:

As our offline and online worlds merge together as never before, anything and anyone can conceivably become a target as the resources that hacktivists use are all online. While their goal is to bring more awareness to a particular issue, many hacktivist campaigns go further than that, causing at the very least distraction and irritation, with many actions ending in service disruption, loss of reputation, or data compromises. Some hacktivists have [deface websites](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xywmxk/hacktivists-deface-lenovos-website) and [shut down companies with distributed denial of services attacks](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/anonymous-hacktivists-launch-ddos-attacks-against-websites-donald-trump-1552750).
