# _Hacktivism_

**In this part of our topic we will be talking about hacktivism.**

If we take a close look to this term, we can find out that it is the result of the mix of activism (action of using vigorous campaigning to bring about political or social change) and hacking (gain unauthorized data in a system or computer). So we could define a hacktivist as a person that breaks into any computer or system for a politically or socially motivated purpose. In the bottom line, **any hacktivist has to become a hacker first**, because without all the coding knowledge there will be no way for him to protest about social, political or economical affairs. 

Activism itself is no crime, but when your are accessing restricted platforms and thus becoming a hacker, the law will put you in trouble. This is no surprise since it would be way too chaotic if anyone had total freedom of speech (and access) to every platform. But when it comes to making noise online, a hacktivist is on top of the ranking for sure. One of the worldâ€™s most famous hacktivists is nicknamed Anonymous. From 2008 to 2012 he managed to recruit a large number of Tunisian hackers to help take down eight governments sites in what was called **Operation _Tunisia_**. (203 words).
