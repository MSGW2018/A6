# Introduction to Politics

In these times of change where access to information seems to be unlimited, there has been some drastic new implementations when it comes to activism, citizen participation or even government’s information storage. We are then going to pay a closer look to some of this phenomena that explain in which way society is going. **Hacktivism** as the new form of expressing disagreement with the establishment, open government as the new way of saving and accessing public data and finally, e-participation as the new way of citizens to participate and communicate with their governments. Exciting times ahead, that’s for sure, but will these new and drastic changes actually sink in the population’s minds to become the new form of society? Or will the hectic speed of the implementation of these changes affect the reaction of the population producing a repulsive mindset? There is no other way to find out than analyzing and discussing each and every topic to try to predict what the next years will bring. One thing is for sure, there will be no way of practicing modern citizenship without full time or partial access to any form of an online platform.
