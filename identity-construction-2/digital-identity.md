## Digital identity ##

As Wikipedia says, 

> “a **digital identity** is information on an entity used by computer systems to represent an external agent. That agent may be a person, organisation, application, or device.”

A digital identity has information which permits the user to be authorized to interact online with a business system without the need of human work or implication. Also, this information allows computers to intercede in relationships created online.

The concept “digital identity” is also used for the identification of people in civil and personal terms in the web. This happens because of the spread of online representation of people.

The uses of the internet have changed and, nowadays, civil or national data is often required to access some sites or information. People identification has become so important in some online sites, that the term of “digital identity” is changing its definition. All the information that a person gives with his or her activity is on the internet. Someone’s passwords, Google searches, online shopping, birth data, etc. All these elements are a user’s identity. It is due to this definition change that another term has emerge: the online identity.

The identity created by users in online communities is what we call the **online identity**, also called  the "internet identity" or "internet persona". This concept can be used as a presentation of each user. Users do not always use their real names in these communities, they choose to use another types of nicknames, and this often reveals some relevant personality information of them. Social relationships are very determinant for the creation of an internet identity.

In addition, the form of representation of those users is not only by the use of these nicknames, because they can also have  a “physical representation” of themselves with an avatar. With their avatars, users establish interaction with other users of online communities.


**Personally identifiable information**, sensitive personal information or personal information is data that can be used to connect, search or recognize a person.

As it is not strange, this personal information is easier to find on the internet and this may involve many issues. Personal information can be used with criminal objectives, so many websites worked in privacy policies so user’s information is safe and difficult to access.

The [**digital footprint**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_footprint) or "digital shadow" is the combination of “digital activities, actions, contributions and communications” done by a user on the Internet.
There are two types of digital footprints: passive and active. 
Passive refers to the collected data without the user knowing it. 
Active is the one that has the searched information and the activities that have been done by the user because he or she decided to do it.

Digital footprints have became an issue in terms of digital privacy, security and reputation. The private information these footprints contain can be used by companies in whichever way they want.
