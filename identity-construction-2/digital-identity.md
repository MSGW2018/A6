## Digital identity ##

As Wikipedia says, 

> “a **digital identity** is information on an entity used by computer systems to represent an external agent. That agent may be a person, organisation, application, or device.”

A digital identity has information which permits to the user to be authorised to interact online with a business system without the need of human work or implication. Also, this information allows computers to intercede in relationships created online.

The concept “digital identity” is also used for the identification of people in civil and personal terms in the web. This happens because of the spread of  online representation of people.

The uses of the internet have changed and, nowadays, civil or national data is often required to access some sites or to get to some content. People identification has become so important in some online sites, that the term of “digital identity” is changing its definition and it is turning to be all the information that a person gives with his or her activity on the internet. Someone’s passwords, Google searches, online shopping, birth data, etc. All these elements are a user’s identity. It is due to this definition change that another term has emerge: the online identity.

The identity created by users in online communities is what we call the **online identity**, also called as internet identity or internet persona. This concept can be used as a presentation of each user. Users do not always use their real names in this communities, they choose to use another type of nicknames, and this often reveal some relevant personality information of them. Social relationships are very determinant for the creation of an internet identity.

In addition, the form of representation of those users is not only by the use of this nicknames, because they can also have like a “physical representation” of themselves with an avatar. With their avatars users establish interaction with other users of online communities.


**Personally identifiable information**, sensitive personal information or personal information is data that can be used to connect, search out or recognize a person.

As it is not strange, this personal information is easier to find on the internet and this have carry many issues. Personal information can be used with criminal objectives, so many websites worked in privacy policies so user’s information is safe and difficult to access.

The [**digital footprint**] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_footprint) or digital shadow is the combination of “digital activities, actions, contributions and communications” done by a user on the Internet.
There are two types of digital footprints: passive and active. The first refers to the collected data without the user knowing it. The second one is the one that has information that has been searched and the activities that have been done by the user because he or she decided to do it.

Digital footprints have became an issue in terms of digital privacy, security and reputation. The private information these footprints contain can be used by companies in whichever way they want.
