There has been a tendency, for a few years now, of users contacting each other through digital services to help or to provide a service at a lower price than the market offers. The second hand market also has been very used, and actually there are many companies that offer such service. 

Some of the most powerful companies that offer this kind of services would be, for example:

## **Blablacar** 

Is a marketplace for carpooling, that is, that several people travel in the same vehicle. Blablacar is actually available in 21 countries, almost in Europe, but it is also available in some countries of south america and India. In this marketplace you can get in touch with a driver that is going to make a trip to a destination that interests you, so you are going to share costs, especially the fuel cost. 

## **Airbnb** 

Airbnb is an American online marketplace and hospitality service for people to lease or rent their apartments, hostel beds, or hotel rooms, so they participate or facilitate experiences related to tourism. The company works as a broker which receives percentage service fees in conjunction with every booking. Airbnb is an example of collaborative consumption and sharing. The company has over 4 million lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries and has facilitated over 260 million check-ins.

## **Wallapop**
