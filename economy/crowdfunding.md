# **CROWDFUNDING**

[Crowdfunding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b5-iEnW70k) is the search for funding for our project through the set of small contributions made by many people. In this way, among many small investors it is possible to reach the amounts that we need to undertake without having to resort to the traditional means of financing.

This mechanism has gained ground in recent months to finance projects, companies or people who are unattended by traditional banking, because there are platforms on the internet that raise money from individuals who are willing to donate, lend or invest resources.

There are many modalities, and depending on where your business idea is or how you want to return the investment made to your patrons, it will be convenient to opt for one or the other.

## **The most common modalities**

**CROWFUNDING OF DONATIONS** 

This is the only case in which investors do not get anything in return for the donation, except for the personal satisfaction of having put their two cents in a project and see how it grows. Generally, this kind of Crowdfunding projects tend to be social, ecological and, to a lesser extent, business projects themselves, although there are cases.

**CROWFUNDING OF REWARD / PERK-BASED** 

This modality is one of the most widespread, it consists of taking a beta, demonstration, or first milestone of our project to the market to see if it captures the interest of investors and move forward with the project of having a good reception. It's like throwing an SOS into the water, and if someone picks up the bottle, you execute the first phase of your idea described in your message. The investor obtains a discount in the final product, exclusivity when obtaining the first units, appearing in the credits, and a long etcetera.

**CROWFUNDING OF INVESTMENT OR EQUITY** 

Here the aim is to capture amounts that range between € 20,000 and € 200,000. The investor is given shares of the company in exchange.

**CROWFUNDING OF LOAN, THE CROWDLENDING** 
Here what is sought is financing in exchange for paying an interest to the investor, as if it were a bank but with many people behind your idea supported. Although it is true that in general the average interest is higher than in a bank, depending on the risk of the business idea, and ranges from 5 to 20%.
