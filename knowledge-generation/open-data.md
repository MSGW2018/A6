#What is open data?#
Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share. Governments, businesses, and individuals can use open data to bring about social, economic, and environmental benefits.
##Uses:##
1. Re-use/Redistribution: data is provided under terms that permit-resuse and redistribution including the intermixing with other datasets. 
2. Availability & Access: Data must be available as a whole and also at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost. Also, the data must be available in a modifiable and convenient form. 
Universal Participation:
Everyone should be able to use, re-use, and redistribute. This means there should be no discrimination against people or groups. 
*Open data does not just cover government and public administration data records but also input from educational institutions, non-profit organizations, broadcasting companies, and more. It also doesnâ€™t limit itself to just text form but it also includes all data formats, like maps, traffic data, statistics, weather data, geo-data, etc. There is also free access data, but open data involves free access data as well as a collaborative generation of new data from different sources. It is important to understand that open data is not only about using a technical level when processing data but also of having free access to the knowledge and producing that new knowledge as a collaborative group on the social level.
