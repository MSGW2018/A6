# What is crowdsourcing #
The term "crowdsourcing" was coined in 2005 by Jeff Howe and Mark Robinson, editor at *Wired*, to describe how businesses were using the Internet to "outsource work to the crowd". Howe, who first published a definition for the term _crowdsourcing_ in a companion blog post, fist defined as:"Simply defined, crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call. This can take the form of peer-production (when the job is performed collaboratively), but is also often undertaken by sole individuals. The crucial prerequisite is the use of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers."


Crowdsourcing is “the practice of obtaining information or input unto a task or project by enlisting the services of a large number of people, either paid or unpaid, typically via the Internet”.

Crowdsourcing can take place on many different levels and across various industries. People involved in crowdsourcing can work as paid freelancers who contribute their knowledge to bring innovation in a certain industry, or to help a certain cause. Others work on crowdsourcing on a voluntary basis, for instance, by reporting accidents through traffic apps to provide real-time information to app users.

## When and how to use crowdsourcing ##

1.	*Problem solving*
Crowdsourcing allows for bringing together the knowledge of hundreds or thousands of people to generate ideas or solve problems. Crowdsourcing can be used to reduce the costs of businesses. Company logo designs can be crowdsourced for instance, but businesses focus on more challenging issues, like air pollution, child labor, cleaning the world’s oceans as well.

2.	*Labor intensive tasks*
Businesses can use crowdsourcing for labor intensive tasks. If a task - for example designing a website - needs to be done, a company can higher freelancers or publish a competition on a crowdsourcing site to get the design with an affordable price. Besides that, more than one person can work on that project at the same time which means the project can be finished in a shorter period of time. 
3.	*Content creation*
The most common practice is sourcing the public for content creation. Wikipedia, Google, Facebook, Glassdoor does it. Content which is created by a large group of people is often considered to be more trustworthy or reliable than a marketing content. [Source](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253959)

## Pros and Cons of crowdsourcing ##

Pros :+1: | Cons :-1:
----------|----------
-**Higher probability of success**: digital crowdsourcing platforms make it possible that people are able to work on the project from anywhere and at any time of the day | Danger of manipulation: it is possible that competitors manipulate the project by giving wrong feedback 
Saves time and money: people come together digitally | Danger of loss of image: if the product/project you are presenting to the people is only supposedly innovative

**Marketing measure - Collect data and customers contacts**: open projects can create attention from possible customers (advertisement) and companies can collect data from a target group | Danger of internal conflict: people who are responsible for a project should be integrated at all time, if not they could feel threatened

**Access to resources**: the user can advertise and sell their skills on platforms - allows more people to access a universally ashared set of resources | Cost of management: outsourcers have to deal with workers directly - might result in spending time and money on managing the resources effectively
Transparency - real world data: user reviews on services and products makes the transaction data more transparent - highly rated users can be rewarded and fake profiles can be pointed out easily | Quality control: people engage directly, therefore, safety and quality control can become an issue since it is easier to create a fake identity online than in real life

## How does crowdsourcing changes the user's role in knowledge generation ##

Crowdsourcing allows individuals to collectively contribute ideas, time, expertise to a project or cause. Each individual is involved in the creation of knowledge, people are contributing to something bigger than themselves, which gives them a high level of satisfaction. It became easier to not only access information online but also to contribute to it. Everyone, with access to the internet, is able to have an impact on projects. With this ability there is also a resposibility. Crowdsourcing does not work if only a few people participate. 

*Example* **Person A** speaks five lanugages fluently and helps other users to translate documents from one language into another. But **person A** does not know a lot about taxes and seeks for help online. **Person B** who is an expert in that field helps out **person A**. Either this is done for an amount of money or for free.

You benefit from it but you also contribute to it, if you can. Therefore, each individual's skills are important. You may not master many lanugages but you are good in designing websites.
