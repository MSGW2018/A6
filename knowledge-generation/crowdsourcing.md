Crowdsourcing can take place on many different levels and across various industries. People involved in crowdsourcing can work as paid freelancers who contribute their knowledge to bring innovation in a certain industry, or to help a certain cause. Others work on crowdsourcing on a voluntary basis, for instance, by reporting accidents through traffic apps to provide real-time information to app users.

There are various platforms with online communities that enable to collectively contribute to ideas. For instance, GitHub, which is helping companies to work together by crowdsourcing software. [Source](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226707)


###**When and how to use crowdsourcing**

1.	Problem solving
Crowdsourcing allows for bringing together the knowledge of hundreds or thousands of people to generate ideas or solve problems. Crowdsourcing can be used to reduce the costs of businesses. Company logo designs can be crowdsourced for instance, but businesses focus on more challenging issues, like air pollution, child labor, cleaning the world’s oceans as well.
2.	Labor intensive tasks
Businesses can use crowdsourcing for labor intensive tasks (here we need to add examples but didn’t yet understand them :D) 
3.	Content creation
The most common practice is sourcing the public for content creation. Wikipedia, Google, Facebook, Glassdoor does it. Content which is created by a large group of people is often considered to be more trustworthy or reliable than a marketing content. [Source](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253959)


###**How does crowdsourcing changes the user's role in knowledge generation**

Crowdsourcing allows individuals to collectively contribute ideas, time, expertise to a project or cause. Each individual is involved in the creation of knowledge, people are contributing to something bigger than themselves, which gives them a high level of satisfaction. etcetc
