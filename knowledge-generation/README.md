# **Knowledge Generation** #
## *Definition* ##
Knowledge Generation is the construction of new concepts or ideas through interactions between implicit and explicit knowledge in individual human minds. [source](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/knowledge-creation.html)
It can occur formally through directed research and experimental development in companies, academic and nonprofit institutions but also informally in a working environment through interactions in organizations or the general economy. 
People/users are the critical input for knowledge generation - it can be an individual or even a team of several people. Indicators of knowledge generations focus on characteristics of human capital inputs and outputs.
