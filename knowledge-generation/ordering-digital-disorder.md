###Scientists have theorized that our constant access to the internet reshaping our brains, making them different from our predecessors. If we do not use our technology with moderation, the chance for a digital disorder to take over increases signiicantly. 
Some disorders include Nomophobia, Technoference, Fauxcellarm, Cyberchondria and "Truman Show" Delusion. 
Nomophobia is the fear of fear of being disconnected; more specifically, disconnected from one's smartphone. When someone becomes stressed or anxious when they cannot use their phones for a long period of time. Researchers have found that approximately 66% of users suffer from this disorder. 
Technoference is the digital interference of smartphones when people are out together. For example, when a couple is having dinner together at a restaurant, but spending their dinner "together" surfing the internet on their phone or texting or calling. 
Fauxcellarm is "phantom ringing" when you think your phone has rung, but once you check it, there is nothing. A clinical psycologist found that approximately 2/3 of his test participants in his study experience this disorder. 
Cyberchondria is when people are going to the internet for health advice and treatment options, this usually results in overdiagnosis.
